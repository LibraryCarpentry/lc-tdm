## Text Mining Terminology

To start with here is a bit of basic terminology that will be used in this lesson:

__Token:__ a single word, letter, number or punctuation mark.

__String:__ a group of characters comprised of words, letters, numbers, punctuation.

__Integer:__ a positive or negative whole number without a decimal point.

__Stop words:__ generally the most common words in a language (e.g. "the", "of", "and" etc.) which are sometimes filtered out during text analysis in order to focus on the vocabulary that conveys more of the content of a piece of text.

__Document:__ a single file containing some text.

__Corpus:__ a collection of documents.
